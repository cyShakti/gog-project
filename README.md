# Decentralized Credit Scoring

A blockchain-based credit scoring system that provides transparent, immutable, and decentralized credit assessment for DeFi lending protocols.

## Project Description

The Decentralized Credit Scoring project revolutionizes traditional credit assessment by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, tamper-proof credit scoring system. Unlike centralized credit bureaus, this system uses on-chain transaction history, payment behavior, and account activity to generate credit scores that are accessible to anyone while maintaining user privacy through pseudonymous addresses.

The smart contract enables authorized lenders to record user payment histories, transaction volumes, and account activities, which are then used to calculate dynamic credit scores. This creates a more inclusive financial system where users can build credit history through their on-chain activities, even without traditional banking relationships.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize access to credit by creating a decentralized, transparent, and globally accessible credit scoring infrastructure. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Credit Bias**: Remove geographical, social, and institutional barriers to credit assessment
- **Increase Financial Inclusion**: Enable unbanked populations to build credit history through blockchain activities
- **Enhance Transparency**: Provide clear, auditable credit scoring algorithms that users can understand and verify
- **Reduce Costs**: Eliminate intermediaries and reduce the cost of credit assessment for both lenders and borrowers
- **Enable Global Access**: Create a universal credit system that works across borders and traditional banking systems

### Scoring Algorithm
The credit score (300-850) is calculated using:
- **40%** Payment History (on-time vs. defaults)
- **30%** Transaction Volume and Activity
- **20%** Account Age and Stability
- **10%** Recent Activity Patterns

### Integration Points
- DeFi lending protocols
- Decentralized exchanges
- Identity verification systems
- Cross-chain bridges

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
